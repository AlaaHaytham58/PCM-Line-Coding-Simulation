# PCM-Line-Coding-Simulation
Developed a Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) system using MATLAB, covering signal sampling, quantization  (8-level), reconstruction, and power-efficient line coding.  ï‚· Compared and simulated bit rate efficiency and applied TDM to multiplex 5 signals, comparing theoretical  and simulated results.
